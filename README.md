jfreplay
========

Java functional replay library

The jfreplay is a simple standalone java library that allows you to to record calls (behaviour) on an interface and then replay those calls onto implementations. In between, behaviour can be transferred over a network, or even persisted.

Jfreplay was created as a way to transfer behaviour such as for example search criteria over a network without having to bother implementing cumbersome and often inflexible specific domain models. After all, the easiest way to descibe behaviour usually is the code itself.


Examples:

java8: TODO
java7: TODO
